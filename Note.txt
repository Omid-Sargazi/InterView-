Currying is a process in functional programming in which we transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions that take one argument at a time.
function f(a, b, c) is transformed to f(a)(b)(c)

////////////////this in javascript////////////

the javascript this keyword which is used in a function, refers to the object it belongs to.
it makes function reusable by letting you decide the object value.
this value is determined entirely by how a function is called.

////////////////////This///////////////////////
typeof this /// Object

////////////////////Map//////////////////
1- a map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data type.
2- To retrieve== recover a value, you can use the corresponding key. 
3- Maps are iterable. they can be used with a for of loop. 
4- Objects are unordered whereas maps are order.
5- keys in object can be only be string or symbol type whereas in maps, they can be of any type. 
6- An object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys id you'r not careful.A 7- map on the other hand dose not contain any keys by default.
8- the number of items in an object must be determined manually where as it is readily available with the size property in a map. 

9- method set for adding a item into map.
10- method delete for deleting of a item
11- method clear for clearing a map.
12- method size for sizing of a map.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////Stack////////////////////////////////////////////

Stack
the stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last in First out.
A stack of plates. 
Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
push into tap and remove from the top.
Browser history tracking. 
undo operation when typing.
/////////////////////////////Queue//////////////////////////////

Queue
1- the queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First in First out(FIFO)
2- the first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed. 
3- Queue is a abstract data structure.
4- Enqueue add element into a queue
5- dequeue remove a element from the queue.
6- peek()==> get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
7- is Empty ==> check if the queue is empty. 
8- size() => get the number of e;elements in the queue.
9- print()==> visualize the elements in the queue
10- Queue Usage
    Printers.
    CPU task scheduling.
    Callback queue in javascript runtime.

/////////////////////////Circular Queue///////////////////////////
the size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
Circular queue usage
1- Clock
2- streaming data
3- Traffic lights
