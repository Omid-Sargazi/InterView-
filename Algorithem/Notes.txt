A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
A data structure is a collection of data value, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.
DOM- Tree data structure
Browser back and forward - Stack data structure
OS job scheduling - Queue data structure

Built in data structure
1- Arrays
2- Objects
3- Sets 
4- Maps

Custom data structure
1- Stacks
2- Queues
3- Circular Queues
4- Linked lists
4- Hash table
5- Trees
6- Graphs
//////////////////////////////////////////// Arrays//////////////////////
An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values.
Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. you can store string, booleans, numbers ot even Objects all in the same array

Array are resizable. you don't have to declare the size of an array before creating.
Arrays are iterables. they can be used with a for of loop.
Array.push(Item) Add Item to end of Array.
Array.unshift(Item) Add Item to start of Array.
arr.pop(); // remove item from the end of the array.
arr.shift() // remove item from the beginning of the array.


for(const i of Array){
    console.log(i) // show items in Array
}


there are methods like map, filter, reduce, concat, alice and splice, 
Array - Big-O time  complexity 
insert/remove from end - O(1)
Insert remove from beginning - O(n)
Access - O(1)
Search - O(n)
push/pop - O(1)
shift/ unshift/ concat/ slice and splice - O(n)
forEach / map / filter / reduce - O(n)

//////////////////////////////////////////// Objects //////////////////////

1- An objects is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The key must either be a string or symbol data type where as the value can be of any data type.

2- to retrieve a value you can use the corresponding key. this can be achieve using the dot notation or bracket notation.

3- Object is not an iterables, You can not use it with a for of loop.

Object - Big-O time complexity 
insert - O(1)
Remove - O(1)
Access - O(1)
Search - O(n)
Object.keys() - O(n)
Object.values() - O(n)
Object.entries() - O(n)


//////////////////////////////////////////// Set //////////////////////
1- An set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values however must be unique.
2- Set can contain a mix of different data types. you can store string, booleans, numbers ot even Objects all in the same array
3- sets are dynamically sized. you don't have to declare the size of the set before creating it.
4- Sets do not maintain an insertion order.
5- sets are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

/////////////////////////methods in set////////////////////////////

1- set.add()
2- set.has()
3- set.delete()
4- set.size
5- set.clear()

Sets and Arrays

1- Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot.
2- Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets.
3- Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays.

how to determine "this"?
Implicit binding
explicit binding
new binding
default binding


////////////Factorial///////////////////
given an integer "n" find the Factorial of that integer
///////////////////////////////Recursion//////////////////////

1- Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller
instance of the same problem. 
2- Recursion is when a function calls itself. 
Why?
3- a great technique to simplify your solution
4- every recursive solution needs to have a base case
Tips for Recursive solution
    1- figure out how to break down the problem into smaller version of the same problem 
    2- Identify the base case for Recursion

//////////////////////////Closure//////////////////////////

Nested (child) functions have access to the scope of their parent functions

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
A closure is created when we defined a function, not when a function is executed.
